            <h3>Ramen salad</h3>
            <p>Originating from Hokkaido, Japan, in 4th place we have the <strong>Ramen salad</strong>! Made with lettuce, tomato, sweetcorn, cucumber, and egg. It is dressed with sesame dressing and Japanese mayonnaise. It is often served in Izakayas in the region as a light snack. While looking like a food abomination it does taste pretty good! Its ramen and a salad, how is that going to taste bad?</p>

            <h3>Potato salad</h3>
            <p>Found worldwide and in 3rd place we have the <strong>Potato salad</strong>. Made from potatoes, and varies throughout different regions of the world. American versions often use mayonnaise, sour cream or milk dressing. We all love potatoes, so placing them into a salad should make us love salads... right..? Well, probably not.

            <h3>Caprese salad</h3>
            <p>Originating from the italian region of Campania we have the <strong>Caprese salad</strong>. Made of sliced fresh buffalo mozzarella, tomatoes and basil, and seasoned with salt, pepper, and olive oil. This salad is extremely good, and its gorgeous to look at! We are also a bit biased because it appears in the anime Jojo's Bizzare Adventure, so well... 2nd place!</p>

            <h3>Honorable mention</h3>
            <p><strong>Caesar salad.</strong> Originating from Mexico and made using Romaine lettuce and croutons dressed with parmesan cheese, lemon juice, olive oil, egg, Worcestershire sauce, anchovies, and black pepper. We all have gone to the popular fast food company McDonalds before, seen their Caesar salad and said <em>"Why would anyone eat that?"</em> Well, to those people all we have to say is you should try it some time, it might taste better than you expect!</p>
