            <h3>Garden salad</h3>
            <p>Your classic and common salad that is found worldwide. Made with lettuce such as iceberg, romaine, or mesclun greens and including toppings such as tomatoes, carrots, onions, cucumbers, mushrooms, and bell peppers. We have all been forced to eat a salad like this one before! It's healthy, it's boring, and it can taste surprisingly good! And as such, the <strong>garden salad</strong> wins 5th place.</p>

            <h3>Ramen salad</h3>
            <p>Originating from Hokkaido, Japan, in 4th place we have the <strong>ramen salad</strong>! Made with lettuce, tomato, sweetcorn, cucumber, and egg. It is dressed with sesame dressing and Japanese mayonnaise. It is often served in Izakayas in the region as a light snack. While looking like a food abomination, it does taste pretty good! Its ramen and a salad, how is that going to taste bad?</p>

            <h3>Potato salad</h3>
            <p>Found worldwide, and in 3rd place, we have the <strong>potato salad</strong>. Made from potatoes and varies throughout different regions of the world. American versions often use mayonnaise, sour cream, or milk dressing. We all love potatoes, so placing them in a salad should make us all love salads, right? Well, probably not. But we love potato salads, so third place it is!</p>

            <h3>Caprese salad</h3>
            <p>Originating from the Italian region of Campania, we have the <strong>caprese salad</strong>. Made of sliced fresh buffalo mozzarella, tomatoes, and basil, and seasoned with salt, pepper, and olive oil. This salad is extremely good, and it's gorgeous to look at! We are also a bit biased because it appears in the anime <em>Jojo's Bizzare Adventure</em>, so well, 2nd place!</p>

            <h3>Honorable mention</h3>
            <p><strong>Caesar salad.</strong> Originating from Mexico and made using Romaine lettuce and croutons dressed with parmesan cheese, lemon juice, olive oil, egg, Worcestershire sauce, anchovies, and black pepper. We have all gone to the popular fast food company McDonalds before, seen their Caesar salad, and said, <em>"Why would anyone eat that?"</em> Well, to those people, all we have to say is that you should try it some time, it might taste better than you expect!</p>

            <h3>Pasta salad</h3>
            <p><strong>Pasta salad</strong> is, objectively, the best salad ever made. Prepared with one or more types of pasta, usually chilled, and most often tossed in a vinegar, oil, or mayonnaise-based dressing. It looks good, tastes good, and makes us want more and more. First place, thats all we have to say.</p>
