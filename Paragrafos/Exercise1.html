        We passed upon the stairs
        We spoke of was and when
        Although I wasn't there
        He said I was his friend
        
        Which came as a surprise
        I spoke into his eyes
        I thought you died alone
        A long, long time ago
        
        Oh, no, not me
        We never lost control
        You're face to face
        With the man who sold the world
        
        I laughed and shook his hand
        And made my way back home
        I searched from form and land
        For years and years I roamed
        
        I gazed the gazeless stare
        We walked a millions hills
        I must have died alone
        A long, long time ago
        
        Who knows? Not me
        I never lost control
        You're face to face
        With the man who sold the world
        
        Who knows? Not me
        We never lost control
        You're face to face
        With the man who sold the world
